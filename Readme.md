## üöÄ Project Description
ROZGAR is a community-driven platform connecting underprivileged individuals, students, and those in need of financial support with local job opportunities. Our mission is to create an accessible ecosystem where people can find meaningful work within their locality, develop skills, and achieve financial independence. ROZGAR bridges the gap between local businesses seeking temporary or permanent help and individuals seeking employment, creating sustainable livelihoods and strengthening local economies.
